## Introduction 简介
This wheelchair bed was created in response to China's aging population. The physiological function of the elderly is degraded, as is the mobility of the limbs and personal self-care ability. It requires the help of medical staff to complete normal daily routines. The development of a multi-functional intelligent nursing bed came about to meet the nursing needs of the elderly while reducing the strain on the social medical staff. The intelligent nursing bed can significantly reduce the workload of medical staff while also making medical work easier and more convenient. It can be used for patient examination, diagnosis, monitoring, recovery, and home care.

## Prototype 轮椅床模版
This intelligent wheelchair bed with multifunctional functions combines the functions of a nursing bed and an electric wheelchair. It is possible to switch freely between the nursing bed and the wheelchair by changing the posture of the wheelchair bed. Working in a nursing bed has the functions of turning left and right, bending the legs, raising the back support, and so on, through auxiliary exercises and posture adjustments for the elderly, to avoid squeezing of muscles and blood vessels or muscle atrophy caused by the elderly in bed for an extended period; working in a wheelchair has the functions of turning left and right, bending the legs, raising the back support, and so on. It has the walking function of an electric wheelchair, allowing the elderly to move around on their own. The wheelchair bed is constructed with high-quality bed surface materials. The bed body is spacious and has excellent air permeability, durability, and comfort. The steel frame material of the bed body is combined with safety guardrails to ensure the elderly's safety. The wheelchair bed is equipped with an autonomous navigation system to avoid collisions with obstacles or entering a trap, as well as to ensure the safety of the elderly's walking function when using the wheelchair bed. The wheelchair bed with an embedded intelligent voice control system is a new type of non-contact control method that enables convenient and quick control of the wheelchair bed's various movements. The wheelchair bed includes a remote control. It can help medical staff provide unified monitoring and management of a large number of patients in hospitals, and it can help family members provide all-weather care for the elderly in-home care.

## Smart Toilet system for the wheelchair bed 轮椅床智能马桶系统
Currently, the toilet allows the user to complete urination and defecation on the wheelchair bed, significantly reducing the nursing staff's labor intensity. Following defecation, the cleaning nozzle extends to clean the user's buttocks. When the cleaning is finished, the toilet's electric hot air blows around to dry the user's cleaned parts.
