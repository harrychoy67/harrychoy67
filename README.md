## Introduction 简介
该款护理床是在中国人口老龄化的背景下研制而成的，老年人的生理机能明显衰退，四肢活动能力下降，个人自理能力变差，需要医护人员进行帮助才能完成正常的生活作息，为了满足对老年人的护理需求和降低对社会医护人员需求的压力，多功能智能护理床的研制应运而生，通过该智能护理床可以大幅降低医护人员的工作强度，使医护工作变得更加简单方便，可用于病人检查诊断监护以及疗养和家庭护理等。

This wheelchair bed was created in response to China's aging population. The physiological function of the elderly is degraded, as is the mobility of the limbs and personal self-care ability. It requires the help of medical staff to complete normal daily routines. The development of a multi-functional intelligent nursing bed came about to meet the nursing needs of the elderly while reducing the strain on the social medical staff. The intelligent nursing bed can significantly reduce the workload of medical staff while also making medical work easier and more convenient. It can be used for patient examination, diagnosis, monitoring, recovery, and home care.

## Prototype 轮椅床模版
该款多功能智能轮椅床集护理床和电动轮椅两种功能于一身，通过对轮椅床进行姿态变换可在护理床和轮椅两种工作状态中自由切换。工作于护理床状态时具有左右翻身、曲抬腿、支背上升等功能，通过对老年人进行辅助运动和姿势调整，避免老年人长期卧床造成肌肉血管被挤压或肌肉萎缩；工作于轮椅状态时具备电动轮椅的行走功能，使老年人能够方便的自行运动。该轮椅床采用优质的床面材料，床体宽敞具有透气性好、耐用舒适的特点，床体采用的钢架材料搭配安全护栏，为老年人提供安全保障。轮椅床搭配了自主导航系统能够避免轮椅床和障碍物的碰撞或驶入陷阱，保障老年人在使用轮椅床的行走功能的安全。内嵌智能语音控制系统的轮椅床是一种新型的非接触式控制方式，对轮椅床的各种运动实现方便快捷的控制。轮椅床实现了远程控制功能，应用于医院时可以辅助医护人员对大批量患者进行统一监护管理，应用于家庭护理时可以帮助家属为老年人提供全天候的关照。

This intelligent wheelchair bed with multifunctional functions combines the functions of a nursing bed and an electric wheelchair. It is possible to switch freely between the nursing bed and the wheelchair by changing the posture of the wheelchair bed. Working in a nursing bed has the functions of turning left and right, bending the legs, raising the back support, and so on, through auxiliary exercises and posture adjustments for the elderly, to avoid squeezing of muscles and blood vessels or muscle atrophy caused by the elderly in bed for an extended period; working in a wheelchair has the functions of turning left and right, bending the legs, raising the back support, and so on. It has the walking function of an electric wheelchair, allowing the elderly to move around on their own. The wheelchair bed is constructed with high-quality bed surface materials. The bed body is spacious and has excellent air permeability, durability, and comfort. The steel frame material of the bed body is combined with safety guardrails to ensure the elderly's safety. The wheelchair bed is equipped with an autonomous navigation system to avoid collisions with obstacles or entering a trap, as well as to ensure the safety of the elderly's walking function when using the wheelchair bed. The wheelchair bed with an embedded intelligent voice control system is a new type of non-contact control method that enables convenient and quick control of the wheelchair bed's various movements. The wheelchair bed includes a remote control. It can help medical staff provide unified monitoring and management of a large number of patients in hospitals, and it can help family members provide all-weather care for the elderly in-home care.
